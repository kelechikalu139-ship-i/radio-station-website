     article:"Despite ongoing 5G rollout, operators encounter persistent obstacles in swampy and riverine regions such as Bayelsa (NCC, 2024). Conventional antenna deployments suffer from unmanaged interference, NLOS propagation, and inadequate spatial selectivity (Qasim et al., 2025). This results in limited coverage, high outage probability, and poor user experience (Frontiers Review, 2023). Thus, there is a need for cost‑effective, deployable solutions that significantly enhance per‑site capacity (Arun, 2024)."
